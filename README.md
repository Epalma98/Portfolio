# wk2-challenge
A portfolio webpage displaying my applications for my potential employers.

## Description

I started by creating an HTML file that included a headshot photo, an about me section, a section displaying my work, my contact info, and my resume. 

I then created a CSS file to make the webpage not only look more visually appealing, but also to make it more responsive when viewing it on different size devices.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

When loading up the webpage, you'll have a navigation bar at the top that has: About Me, Work, Contact Me, and Resume. By clicking anyone of those tabs, you'll be navigated to the related section on the webpage. 

When on the "Work" section, if you hover over the different application thumbnails, the image will react by becoming more colorful.

The links at the bottom of the webpage will direct you to my different social pages.
