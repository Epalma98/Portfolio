                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in central California. After graduating high school, I attended 
                    a community college in my hometown. My second year at community college, I moved
                    to San diego and transferred to Mesa College where I finished the necessary course 
                    required to transfer into San Diego State University. While working on my bachelors degree
                    in marketing, I worked in membership sales at Fit Athletic Club in Little Italy.

                    After graduating from SDSU with my marketing degree, I felt less inclined to pursue a career 
                    marketing. After hearing about this software development bootcamp from a friend, I decided
                    to research potential career paths in this field. I've always liked creating things from scratch 
                    and seeing the possibility of using my graphic design background with the new skills learned
                    in software development, I decided to enroll in this bootcamp!
